# Chapter Compiler

This program takes a directory with various CBZ files, a directory with various subdirectories with images, or a directory with images as an input and outputs them in a single CBZ or Folder labelled "001", "002" ...

> [!NOTE]
> All of these function the exact same with the 'Compile to Folder' option, and will output a single directory instead of a cbz

Let me know if you have any requests or suggestions
