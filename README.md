This program takes in a folder with .cbz files for each chapter of a manga, comic, etc. as an input and another folder to store all the panels as an output.

It will automatically label all the panels starting from 001.

Let me know if you have any requests or suggestions, UI coming soon.

A small program by Dario Gomez :)
