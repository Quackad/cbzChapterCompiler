====================================
A small program by Dario Gomez :)
====================================

This program takes in a folder with .cbz files for each chapter of a manga, comic, etc. as an input and another folder to store all the panels for as an output.

It will automatically label all the panels starting from 001.

Usage:
'chapterCompile.py /input/directory /output/directory'

Let me know if you have any requests or suggestions!
